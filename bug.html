This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with complex responsive design patterns and many custom styles.  The problem is that Tailwind's utility-first approach, while generally efficient, can lead to excessively long class names that exceed the browser's maximum selector length, resulting in CSS being ignored by the browser. This often happens when combining numerous modifiers (e.g., `md:hover:bg-blue-500`) or applying many utilities to a single element.
